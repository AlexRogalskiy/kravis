# A Kotlin grammar for data-frame visualization


Visualzing tablular and relational data is the core of data-science. `kravis` implements a grammar to create a wide range of plots using a standardized set of verbs.



The grammar implemented by kravis is inspired from [`ggplot2`](http://ggplot2.org/)

Example




## How to use


Add the following artifact to your gradle.build

```
compile "com.github.holgerbrandl:kravis:0.1"

You can also use [JitPack with Maven or Gradle](https://jitpack.io/#holgerbrandl/kravis/-SNAPSHOT) to build the latest snapshot as a dependency in your project.

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
dependencies {
        compile 'com.github.holgerbrandl:kravis:-SNAPSHOT'
}
```
